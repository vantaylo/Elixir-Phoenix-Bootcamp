# Parallel Letter Frequency

Instructions
Count the frequency of letters in texts using parallel computation.

Parallelism is about doing things in parallel that can also be done sequentially. A common example is counting the frequency of letters. Create a function that returns the total frequency of each letter in a list of texts and that employs parallelism.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `frequency` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:frequency, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
